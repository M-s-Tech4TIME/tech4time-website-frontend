<?php
/**
 * Tech4TIME — contact form handler.
 *
 * The only server-side code on the site. Everything else is static; this exists
 * because a contact form has to post somewhere.
 *
 * It answers both ways the form can arrive:
 *   - fetch() from forms.js, which sends Accept: application/json and expects
 *     {ok, message} or {ok:false, error} back;
 *   - a plain POST from a browser with no JavaScript, which gets a rendered
 *     confirmation page back, built from the site's own stylesheets.
 *
 * The validation below deliberately repeats what forms.js already checks. That
 * is not duplication for its own sake: client-side validation is a convenience
 * for the visitor and provides no protection at all, since anything can post
 * here directly.
 *
 * SPAM. The honeypot stops crawlers that fill in every field. It does nothing
 * against a bot written for this form specifically, so there is also a rate
 * limit — a handful an hour from one address, which no visitor will notice.
 * Beyond that the answer is a real challenge, not more regular expressions.
