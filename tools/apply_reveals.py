Mark up the scroll-reveal targets on every page.

Build tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).

    python3 tools/apply_reveals.py            # dry run: report what it would do
    python3 tools/apply_reveals.py --write    # apply
    python3 tools/apply_reveals.py --strip    # remove every marker again

A page that builds part of itself with a PHP loop is reported and left alone,
by all three. See renders_a_list().

WHY A TOOL AND NOT FIFTEEN HAND EDITS
The reveal targets are a structural rule ("each section's header, then its
body"), not sixteen independent decisions. Written by hand the rule survives
only as long as my patience does, and the pages drift. Here the rule is stated
once, and --strip makes the whole pass reversible, which is what lets it be
tuned rather than argued about.

THE RULE
For every <section> in <main>, descend past a lone .container wrapper, then mark
that wrapper's element children. A child that is a grid of 2..MAX_STAGGER cards
is skipped in favour of its children, so the cards arrive in sequence rather
than as one block.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT MARKED, and why each one matters:

  Heroes (.hero, .page-hero)
      They hold the LCP element. [data-reveal] starts at opacity 0, and an
      element that is transparent at first paint does not count as painted —
      hiding a hero would push Largest Contentful Paint out by the length of the
      animation and damage the exact metric this project cares about. Heroes are
      above the fold and need no reveal to be seen.

  Tab panels (.tabs__panel)
      Hidden panels have no layout box, so IntersectionObserver never reports
      them as intersecting. A card revealed this way inside a closed panel would
      still be at opacity 0 when the visitor opened that tab: content, present
      in the DOM and invisible on screen. This is the failure mode worth being
      most careful about, so nothing inside a panel is marked at all.

  The terminal (.terminal)
      It is inside the hero, and its lines already arrive one by one on their
      own delays. A second fade over the top of that would fight it.

  The privacy policy body (.legal__body)
      Someone reading a privacy policy is looking for a clause, often having
      followed a link straight to it. Animating the text they came for is at
      best noise and at worst an obstacle. Its call-to-action band still
      reveals; the document itself is simply there.

  The header, footer and dock
      Shared markup. Editing it here would break byte-identity with
      tools/templates/ and fail tools/check_shared_markup.py.

  Anything already [hidden]
      Same reasoning as tab panels.
