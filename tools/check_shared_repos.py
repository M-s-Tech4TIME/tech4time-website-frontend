Prove the two repositories still hold the same copy of everything shared.

Build/audit tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).

    python3 tools/check_shared_repos.py
    python3 tools/check_shared_repos.py --clone   # fetch the sibling (CI)

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT check_shared_lib.py CANNOT DO
`tools/check_shared_lib.py` compares each repository's files against a digest
committed in *that same repository*. Its own docstring is honest about the
consequence: edit `lib/html.php` in the backend, run `--update` there, and the
backend passes; the frontend passes too, against its own unchanged copy; and
the two now hold different sanitisers with every check green.

That is not a flaw in it -- a per-repo digest cannot see across repositories,
and it says so. But it means the *actual* property we care about, "these two
files are the same file", has never been checked anywhere. This checks it, the
only way it can be checked: by having both copies present at once.

So the two are complements, not rivals. Keep both:

    check_shared_lib.py    caught an accidental local edit, offline, in one repo
    check_shared_repos.py  catches the halves drifting apart, needing both

WHAT IT COMPARES

    The four runtime files      html.php, contract.php, publish.php, sprite.svg
                                -- read from check_shared_lib.py's own SHARED
                                map, so this file cannot fall behind that one.

    Every same-named tool       Any script that exists in tools/ on both sides
                                must be byte-identical UNLESS it is listed in
                                DIVERGENT below with a reason.

The second rule is deliberately the wrong way round from a list of "files to
keep in step". A list like that has to be remembered; this has to be argued
with. Copy a tool to the other repository and it is covered from that moment,
with no edit here. Let one drift and the run fails until somebody either fixes
it or writes down why the two differ.

WHICH COPY OF THE SIBLING IT COMPARES AGAINST
Beside this one, if it is there -- your working tree, uncommitted changes and
all, which is what you want while working. With --clone it is THE SAME BRANCH
in the sibling: a dev build compares against the sibling's dev, a main build
against its main.

That is not what the first version of this file did, and the difference cost a
red run. It cloned without naming a branch, which gets the repository's DEFAULT
branch -- main here -- so a push to dev compared new work against the last
RELEASED state of the other half and reported drift that was not drift. Two
branches that are supposed to differ are not evidence of anything.

If the sibling has no branch of that name, this falls back to its default and
says so in the output. A comparison against a different branch is worth having
and is worth not mistaking for the real one.

There is still an ordering consequence, and it is the honest one: a change
touching both halves fails here until BOTH are pushed to that branch. At that
moment the two halves genuinely disagree, and a publish between them would be
refused by CONTRACT_VERSION. Push the other half and it goes green. If a
two-repo change could pass with one half landed, this check would be saying the
halves match when it means "I only looked at one of them".

WHEN THE SIBLING IS NOT THERE
Exits 0 with a notice, the way the browser tests and test_qr.py do. This has to
be runnable on a machine with one repository checked out; it is CI that has
both, and CI is where the answer matters.
