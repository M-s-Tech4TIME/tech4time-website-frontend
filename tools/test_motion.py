Prove the scroll reveal never leaves anything unread.

Development tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).
Run from the repo root:  python3 tools/test_motion.py

Needs the PHP CLI, Firefox and geckodriver. Exits 0 with a notice if the
browser pieces are missing.

WHY
A scroll reveal works by hiding content and promising to bring it back. Every
way that promise can be broken ends in the same place — text that is in the
DOM, indexed by search engines, announced by a screen reader, and invisible on
screen. It is the one class of bug where the page looks fine to every static
check in this repo and is unusable to a person.

The ways it can break, each of which has a check below:

  The observer never fires.
      A fractional threshold is a share of the TARGET's area, so an element
      taller than the viewport can never satisfy it. The privacy policy's body
      is such an element. The mechanism now asks for threshold 0.

  The element has no box to observe.
      Anything inside a [hidden] tab panel has zero area, so it never
      intersects. Revealed content there would still be transparent when the
      visitor opened that tab, and switching tabs would show an empty panel.

  The reveal script never arrives.
      A dropped request or a parse error leaves the hidden state applied with
      nothing left to lift it. theme-init.js carries a watchdog for this.

  Motion was declined, or scripting is off.
      Then nothing may be hidden in the first place.

  The page is printed.
      Printing does not scroll, so nothing reveals and the paper comes out
      blank wherever the reader had not been.

  Nothing was marked at all.
      The quietest one. A page with no [data-reveal] passes every check here
      without any of them testing anything, which is how the careers page went
      through a full run untouched — it is index.php, and the tool that applies
      the markers only globbed index.html. The home page became index.php later
      and would have walked into the same trap: apply_reveals.py hardcoded
      ROOT/"index.html" at the root, so it stopped seeing the file. It looks for
      both names now, and reports-and-skips this page along with the other four
      that render a list, whose markers are hand-maintained.

The central assertion is the blunt one: load each of the sixteen pages, scroll
from top to bottom, and require every marked element to be fully opaque. If
that holds on every page, the reveal cannot be hiding anything from anyone.

# Walk the document a viewport at a time so every observer has a chance to
# fire, then settle. Reveals are 400ms plus up to seven 80ms steps of stagger,
# so the tail wait has to clear roughly a second.
#
# behavior: 'instant' is not decoration. base.css sets scroll-behavior: smooth
# on <html>, which applies to programmatic scrolls too — so a plain scrollTo
# starts an animation rather than moving, and stepping every 80ms left the page
# gliding along somewhere behind the loop. It never reached the bottom before
# the return to the top reversed it, and the last element on the page was
# reported as never revealed about one run in three. The bug was in this
# function, not in the page.
# The step is deliberately less than a viewport. The observer's rootMargin
# holds the reveal back until an element is inside the top 90% of the screen,
# so stepping by a full viewport leaves a seam: an element sitting in that
# bottom tenth at one step is above the top edge at the next, and is never
# inside the observed band at any position the walk stops at. It was missed on
# every run — one element on the about page, one on it-equipment-supply — and
# scrolling straight to it revealed it at once, which is what showed the walk
# was at fault rather than the page. Overlapping steps have no seam.
