"""
A form's named controls hide the form's own DOM properties. Find where that bites.

Development tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).

    python3 tools/check_form_dom.py
    python3 tools/check_form_dom.py -v     # list the collisions that are harmless

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
HTMLFormElement is declared [LegacyOverrideBuiltIns] in the HTML specification.
That one word means a control's name wins over the interface's own property of
the same name -- not the other way round, and with no warning of any kind:

    <form action="?s=careers">
      <input type="hidden" name="action" value="save">
    </form>

    form.action                 -> the INPUT element, not a URL
    String(form.action)         -> "[object HTMLInputElement]"
    fetch(form.action, ...)     -> POST /[object%20HTMLInputElement]  ->  404

Ordinary submission is untouched, because the browser submits from the
attribute and never consults the property. So a form can be correct for years
and break on the day a script starts posting it -- which is exactly what
happened here on 2026-08-28: every button on the admin's careers screen posted
to an address no server has ever served, and the editor answered 404 to saving,
publishing, unpublishing, reordering and deleting alike. Nothing in the PHP was
wrong. No PHP path in either half returns 404 at all.

It got past a 215-check browser suite and an 1845-check accessibility suite
because both drive the markup and neither reads a property off a form.

WHAT IT REFUSES
1. A member of ALWAYS read straight off a form. Those eight decide where a
   request goes, how it is sent, and whether the typing survives -- and every
   one of them can be reached safely through the prototype instead, which is
   what both halves now do. This holds even where nothing is named after them
   today, because "nothing is named that yet" is not a property of the code
   that reads it.
2. Any OTHER member read off a form that some control in this repository is
   actually named after. This half needs no list to maintain: it re-derives
   the collision from the markup on every run, so a field added tomorrow that
   shadows something a script already reads fails tomorrow.

WHAT IT ONLY REPORTS
Control names that shadow a form property nothing currently reads. They are
not faults -- $_POST['action'] is a perfectly good thing to send -- but they
are the loaded half of the mechanism, and somebody about to write
form.something should be able to find out which names are already taken.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE
An identifier it cannot tell is a form. It looks for names that look like one
(form, forms[i], theForm, formEl) because that is what both halves call them.
A form reached as event.target, or handed in as an unhelpfully named argument,
is invisible here -- which is why tools/test_admin_forms.py also presses a real
button on the screen this broke and asserts the answer was not an error.
