"""
A minimal HTML tree with source offsets, for tools that need to edit markup
structurally rather than by regex.

Build tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).

WHY THIS EXISTS
Neither BeautifulSoup nor lxml is installed on this machine, and this project
will not grow a dependency it does not need. html.parser is in the standard
library but is a stream parser: it reports tags as it passes them and keeps no
tree, so it cannot answer "what are this element's children".

This wraps it in the smallest thing that can: a Node tree where every element
remembers where its start tag begins in the source. That offset is what makes
safe edits possible — an attribute can be inserted immediately after the tag
name without re-serialising the document, so nothing else on the page moves and
the diff stays readable.

Re-serialising was the alternative and it is the wrong one here: it would
reformat all sixteen pages, bury the real change in whitespace noise, and put
the shared header/footer blocks at risk of drifting out of byte-identity with
tools/templates/ (see tools/check_shared_markup.py).

NOT A GENERAL PARSER. It handles the markup this project writes: well-formed,
hand-authored, no unclosed <p>, no <table> soup. Malformed input will produce a
malformed tree rather than an error.
