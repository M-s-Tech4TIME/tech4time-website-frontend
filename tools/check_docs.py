"""
Prove the documentation still describes the code.

Development tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see docs/40-reference/tools.md).

    python3 tools/check_docs.py
    python3 tools/check_docs.py -v     # list what passed as well

WHY THIS EXISTS
Documentation rots silently. A tool is deleted, a constant is retuned, a file
moves -- and the prose describing it goes on reading perfectly while being
wrong. That is worse than no documentation, because it is believed.

The project already refuses to let two things drift apart when it can check
them mechanically: check_shared_markup.py for the header copied into sixteen
pages, check_content_model.py for the model, the form and the renderer. This is
the same idea pointed at docs/.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO
Read prose. It cannot tell whether an explanation is still true, only whether
the things the explanation names still exist and still hold the values quoted.
That half is on the author. This catches the half that rots without anybody
touching the docs at all.
