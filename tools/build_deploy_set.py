"""
Build the set of files that goes to the web server, and prove what is in it.

Build/deploy tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).

    python3 tools/build_deploy_set.py --check        # assert, print, change nothing
    python3 tools/build_deploy_set.py --out _deploy  # build it

WHY THIS EXISTS
Until now the upload set was a sentence in a document — an rsync command with
eight --exclude flags, run by hand, correct as long as everybody typed all
eight. The flags are not equally important: seven of them save bandwidth, and
one of them, --exclude='content/', is the only thing standing between a deploy
and every job post the client has written. There is no way to tell them apart
by looking, and the day one is dropped the site keeps working and the loss is
silent.

So the set is built here instead, and CI rsyncs a directory rather than
assembling a rule. What may be uploaded stops being something to remember.

WHY AN ALLOW LIST, NOT AN IGNORE LIST
The two fail in opposite directions. Under an ignore list a new file in the
repository root ships unless somebody thought to exclude it, and the day that
file is a key, a dump or a note-to-self, it is on the internet. Under an allow
list it stays behind unless somebody thought to include it, and the day that
file is a new page, the page 404s.

One of those is discovered by a visitor; the other by a stranger. UPLOAD is
therefore exhaustive, and anything not named in it does not go.

CONTENT IS NOT PART OF THE SET
content/ is the client's data — job posts and contact details typed into
/admin/ on the live server — and the repository's copy is test data. It is
never synced. But the first deploy has to put something there or the two
dynamic pages have nothing to render, so it is built separately, into seed/,
and CI copies that with rsync --ignore-existing: it creates what is absent and
overwrites nothing. A file that exists on the host has been edited by somebody
and wins, permanently, without anyone deciding so on the day.
