"""
Verify the shared header/footer/scripts markup has not drifted between pages.

Build/audit tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).
Run from the repo root:  python3 tools/check_shared_markup.py

The project forbids runtime fetch()-based partials, so the header, footer and
script tags are pasted into all sixteen pages. That is the right call for
reliability, but it means the same markup exists in sixteen places and is free
to drift. This script is the safeguard: it asserts every page still matches the
canonical copies in tools/templates/.

The single permitted per-page difference is the aria-current="page" marker on
the active nav link, which is normalised away before comparison.
