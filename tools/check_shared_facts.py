Facts stated in two documents must still agree.

Development tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).
Run from the repo root:  python3 tools/check_shared_facts.py
Requires the PHP CLI:    sudo apt install php-cli

WHY THIS EXISTS
The privacy policy states the offices, the email and the telephone, and so does
the contact page. They are authored separately on purpose: a controller's
details are a legal statement, and one that changed because somebody edited
another page would be a statement nobody made. But two copies of a fact drift,
and these two already had -- the telephone read "+880 1320 571562" on one page
and "+880 1320571562" on the other, and the Brussels office had a comma on one
and not the other. Nothing told anybody.

WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE
Only the SEED. Content edited in the admin never passes through git -- the
tracked content/*.json are what a fresh deploy starts from, and the host's
copies always win. So this catches a developer committing a drifted seed and
nothing an editor ever does. The half it cannot see is covered where it can be:
the privacy editor draws the same comparison as a standing notice, on every
render, from the same function.

WHY IT SHELLS OUT TO PHP
privacy_shared_facts() lives in lib/contract.php, which is byte-identical
across both repositories. A second implementation of "does the policy still say
this" in Python is exactly the disagreement that shared file exists to prevent
-- it would be the third place the same question was answered, and the first to
answer it differently.

The comparison is on a NORMALISED form: non-breaking spaces and runs of
whitespace collapsed, commas and full stops dropped, case folded. That is what
makes it useful rather than noisy -- it reports a different street and stays
quiet about a different comma.

THE SECOND COMPARISON IS THE FOOTER'S CONTACT ROWS, and it is here for exactly
the same reason as the first. content/chrome.json holds the footer's OWN
telephone numbers, email and addresses -- deliberately, because the contact
page holds every detail in full and a footer holds the part worth putting in
one, worded and ordered to suit it. Two copies again, and this one has already
gone stale once: the Brussels numbers were wrong for weeks under the
arrangement ADR 0023 replaced, and nothing said so.

It looks ONE WAY: what the footer says that the contact page does not. The
other direction is not drift, it is what a footer is, and an alarm that fired
on every correctly-short footer is an alarm nobody would read. chrome_contact_
drift() in lib/contract.php has the rest of the reasoning.

A THIRD COMPARISON USED TO BE HERE and has stopped having anything to compare.
The Organization graph's sameAs list -- the profiles that are this company
elsewhere -- was edited on the SEO screen while the footer linked to the same
profiles in literal markup. The footer's social links are DERIVED from those
rows now (chrome_social() in the frontend's lib/chrome.php), so there is one
copy and nothing to draw.
