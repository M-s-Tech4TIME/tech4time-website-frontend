"""
Prove the editor, the data and the page still describe the same thing.

Build/audit tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).
Run from the repo root:  python3 tools/check_content_model.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
An editable page is three things that have to agree:

    the model      lib/contract.php  — what a field is called and what it holds
    the form       sections/         — where somebody types it
    the renderer   pages/…/index.php — where it comes out

The model moved to lib/contract.php with the repository split: it is the one
file the frontend and the backend hold byte-identical, because a field they
disagree about is a field one of them loses. The helpers that read it stayed
where they were, so "the renderer" is now the page plus lib/contact.php.

Nothing forces them to. Add a band to the contact page and forget the editor,
and the band is unmanageable; drop a band from the page and leave the field in
the editor, and somebody types into a box that changes nothing they can see.
Neither failure raises an error. Both are found here.

This is a structural check, not a taste one: it asserts that every field in the
model is written by the form and read by the page, and that neither of the
other two reaches for a field the model does not define. It cannot tell you
whether the band looks right — that is what the screenshots are for.

TWO REPOSITORIES, ONE CHECK, HALF EACH
Since the split there is no repository holding both the form and the page. The
frontend has the renderer; the backend has the editor; both hold the model,
byte-identical, which is what makes the two halves add up to the whole check.

So this runs whichever half is present and SAYS which one, rather than quietly
checking less than it used to. It refuses to run at all if neither is here,
because "nothing to check" and "everything passed" must not print the same
thing.

It also asserts that it is being asked about every editor there is. Comparing
source text only works while the fields appear in the source as themselves; a
form or a page that loops over its fields hides them from a regex, and careers
does exactly that on both sides. Those are proved by round trip instead, and
named in COVERED_ELSEWHERE — so an editor checked by neither route fails here
rather than being quietly absent, which is what it was until 2026-08-23.
