WHAT IS SHARED, AND WHY EACH ONE IS

    lib/html.php      the sanitiser. The backend sanitises what it stores; the
                      frontend sanitises again what it receives, because a
                      signature proves origin and not safety. Two sanitisers
                      that disagree mean the second one is not a check.

    lib/contract.php  the shape of a document. A field the two spell
                      differently is a field one of them loses on the next save.

    lib/publish.php   the wire format. Disagree here and nothing publishes at
                      all — which is the least bad of the four, because it
                      fails loudly on the first attempt.

    sprite.svg        the icon set. CONTACT_ICONS is in the contract, so the
                      backend offers a fixed list of icons and the frontend
                      has to be able to DRAW every one of them. A sprite that
                      has drifted means a reach row the editor previewed
                      correctly and the public page renders as an empty box —
                      which nothing else here would notice, because both
                      halves would be behaving exactly as written.

WHAT THIS CHECK IS WORTH, HONESTLY
Not much on its own, and it is important to say so where somebody will read it.

Each repository compares its own files against its own committed digest. Edit
lib/html.php in the backend, run --update there, and the backend passes; the
frontend also passes, against its own unchanged copy; and the two now hold
different sanitisers with every check green. A digest compared separately on
each side can only catch an ACCIDENTAL local edit — a hand-patch on a server,
a merge that went sideways, a file half-copied.

The real guarantee is at run time, on the real path, on the day: every
published payload carries contract_version, and the receiving side refuses a
version it does not implement rather than writing a document it would then
mis-render. That check fires against what was actually sent, by the side that
would suffer from the mismatch. See lib/publish.php and
docs/90-decisions/0011-two-repositories.md.

So: this is hygiene. Do not let it stand in for the version.
