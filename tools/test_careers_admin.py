"""
Exercise the job post editor against a local PHP server.

Development tool. NOT deployed to the web server (see tools/README.md).
Run from the repo root:  python3 tools/test_careers_admin.py
Requires the PHP CLI:    sudo apt install php-cli

WHY THIS EXISTS
admin/index.php writes content/careers.json, and pages/careers/index.php
renders whatever it finds there. Code that writes files is worth a test: a bug
in the save path does not show up as an error, it shows up as a job post that
quietly disappeared.

Every test runs against a COPY of the real data file, which is restored
afterwards whether the run passes or fails.

WHAT IT CANNOT COVER
The sign-in itself. This harness creates an admin account in a throwaway
private directory and signs in through the real login page — so what is tested
here is the editor's behaviour once past it. The sign-in is the subject of
tools/test_admin_auth.py.

# check_content_model.py closes exactly this for the contact page, and cannot
# close it here. Both sides of careers are loops: the editor writes its seven
# body fields as name="<?= h($field) ?>", and the page renders them by walking

# and "offers" — so a static check would have to exempt the seven fields most
# likely to drift, and would then announce that all is well.
#
# So this asks PHP what the model holds and puts a distinct marker through
# every field of it, editor to visitor, over HTTP. A field added to
# lib/careers.php is covered the moment it exists, and covered strictly: the
# default is that it must come back verbatim, and a field that cannot carry a
