# Decision records

**Applies to:** both

One file per decision that constrains future work — the kind somebody arriving cold would otherwise
re-litigate, or reverse without knowing what it was holding up.

Each is short and has the same three parts:

- **Decision** — what was decided
- **Context** — what made it necessary
- **Consequences** — what it costs, and what it now forbids

A decision recorded here is not permanent. It is *deliberate*. If the context has changed, write a
new record superseding the old one rather than quietly doing the opposite.

**The numbers are the project's, not this repository's.** After the split, a record about code that
lives only in the other half lives only there — so this list has gaps, and each one names where the
record went. A gap is not a missing decision; it is a decision that belongs to the other half.
