# Deployment

**Applies to:** both

The site deploys by uploading files. There is no build step, so what is in the repository is what
runs on the server.

---

## Current status

**The site is live at `https://tech4time.bd`**, on cPanel with LiteSpeed and PHP 8.2. The first
deploy was done by hand through the File Manager; every deploy since has been a push to `main`.

**Deploys now go through GitHub Actions** — push to `main`, checks run, rsync over SSH, and the
site is asked afterwards whether its protections are still in place. See [ci-cd.md](ci-cd.md).
[routine-deploys.md](routine-deploys.md) is the manual fallback for when the pipeline cannot run.

## In this section

| | |
|---|---|
| [first-deploy.md](first-deploy.md) | scratch → live website, in order |
| [cpanel-host-setup.md](cpanel-host-setup.md) | the host: domains, SSL, PHP, mailboxes, DNS |
| *admin-activation.md* (in tech4time-website-backend) | standing the admin host up: the setup key, the first account, the cutover order |
| [ci-cd.md](ci-cd.md) | **the pipeline**: checks on every push, deploy on `main` |
| [routine-deploys.md](routine-deploys.md) | pushing an update by hand, when the pipeline cannot |
| [environments.md](environments.md) | document roots, `T4T_PRIVATE`, dev data vs production data |

## The three rules

Everything else is detail.

### 1. Never upload `content/`

The host's `content/careers.json` and `content/contact.json` are the **real data**, written by people
from the admin. A deploy that includes them destroys live job posts and contact details.

### 2. Never upload `tools/`

It contains scripts that manipulate the site and one that mints the key both halves sign with. `.htaccess`
blocks the path as a backstop; the rule is that it is never uploaded at all.

### 3. There is no `admin/` here

cPanel writes its own file there. Uploading over it silently removes whatever protection it was
The editor moved to `tech4time-website-backend` with the split, and with it the rule about cPanel writing
its own `.htaccess` into a Directory-Privacy-protected folder. Nothing in this repository ships into
an `admin/` directory, and `tools/build_deploy_set.py` lists `admin` among its forbidden trees so
that a stray one could not.

## What gets uploaded

```
UPLOAD                          DO NOT UPLOAD
  index.html  404.html            tools/
  pages/                          docs/
  assets/                         references/
  lib/                            .git/
  contact-handler.php             content/          ← after the first deploy
  .htaccess                       admin/            ← nothing, ever
  robots.txt  sitemap.xml
  site.webmanifest
```

`content/` is uploaded **once**, on the very first deploy, to seed the files. Never again.

---

## The order that matters

Standing the admin host up has a sequence, and the sequence *is* the safety property — it exists so
the window in which somebody else could create the first admin account never opens. It is the other
repository's procedure now, and it still matters here for one reason: **both private stores must
hold the same `publish.key` before the first save**, or the editor will report every publish
refused.

*admin-activation.md* (in tech4time-website-backend) has it. Do not improvise it.
