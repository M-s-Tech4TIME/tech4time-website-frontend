# Continuous integration and deployment

**Applies to:** both

Every change reaching the server the same way, through checks that cannot be skipped.

---

## What this replaces

The first deploy was a zip built by hand and uploaded through cPanel's File Manager. That worked,
and it does not scale past one person doing it carefully: the set of files that may go to the
server was a sentence in [routine-deploys.md](routine-deploys.md) — an `rsync` line with eight
`--exclude` flags — and seven of those flags save bandwidth while the eighth,
`--exclude='content/'`, is the only thing between a deploy and every job post the client has
written.

Nothing about the two kinds of flag looks different. That is the problem being fixed.

---

## The pieces

| | |
|---|---|
| `tools/build_deploy_set.py` | builds the upload set, and asserts what is in it |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | every check this repository has, on every push |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | push to `main` → checks → dry run → gate → **seed** → sync → verify |
| `tools/verify_live.py` | asks the deployed site whether its protections are still there |

---

## The upload set

`build_deploy_set.py` produces two directories:

```bash
python3 tools/build_deploy_set.py --out _deploy
#   _deploy/site/   → the document root
#   _deploy/seed/   → content/, and only where content/ is empty

python3 tools/build_deploy_set.py --check    # assert it, build nothing
```

**It is an allow list, not an ignore list.** `UPLOAD` names every top-level entry that goes, and
anything not named stays behind. The two fail in opposite directions and only one of them fails
safely:

| | a new file is added and nobody thinks about deployment | |
|---|---|---|
| ignore list | it ships | a stranger finds it |
| **allow list** | it does not ship | a visitor finds a 404 |

`DENY` then removes things carried along by a directory that is otherwise wanted — `*.md`
above all, because cPanel writes its own there and ours would fight it.

`REQUIRED` is the other direction: files whose *absence* is a broken site rather than a missing
feature. `.htaccess` heads that list because it is a dotfile, and both FTP clients and zip tools
have been seen to drop it silently — taking the rules that block `lib/` and `content/` with it, and
leaving a site that looks completely normal.

### Content is not in the set

`content/` holds the client's data: job posts and contact details published from the admin to the live
server. The repository's copy is test data. It is **never** synced.

But a brand-new host has nothing there and the two dynamic pages need something to render, so the
**The seed is copied before the site, not after.** A page that renders from `content/` is useless
until its document is there, and these are two rsyncs with seconds between them — with the site
first, a newly dynamic page is live and rendering from its defaults for the length of that gap:
headings with nothing under them. That was tolerable while the dynamic pages were inner ones and
stopped being so when the home page joined them. Neither step can undo the other: `--ignore-existing`
overwrites nothing, and the site sync protects `/content/` from `--delete`.

The seed directory is copied with `rsync --ignore-existing`: it creates what is absent and overwrites
nothing. A file already on the host has been edited by somebody and wins, permanently, without
anyone having to decide so on the day.

**The seed is built from `CONTRACT_DOCUMENTS`, not from a list of copy calls.** For every document
the contract defines, `build_deploy_set.py` takes `deploy/seed/<name>.json` if there is one and
`content/<name>.json` otherwise, and refuses to build if there is neither.

`deploy/seed/careers.json` carries `jobs: []` — a new host must not launch advertising the test
vacancies — while keeping the real `cv_form_url`. That is the only document with a hand-written
seed. `contact.json` and `company.json` seed from `content/`, which is genuine content and, for
contact, the same file the page footers were built from; seeding either from anywhere else would
make the two disagree, and seeding them empty would give a new host a page of headings with nothing
under them.

### It was a list, and the list went out of step

The company profile shipped with its seed line in **this** repository and never added to the other
one. Nothing failed. `content/company.json` simply never reached the admin host, `company_load()`
fell back to `company_defaults()`, and the editor came up rendering an empty form — over a live page
holding seventy-seven rows. One press of Save would have published the empty one over it.

That is why the loop replaced the list, in both halves, and why `--check` now asserts that every
document in the contract has a seed. There is also a warning in the editor itself now: a section
whose `content/<name>.json` is missing says so before anything can be saved.

## The test workflow

Runs on every push to `dev` and `main`, and on every pull request to `main`. Three jobs, in
parallel:

| Job | What runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `checks` | the static checks, `build_deploy_set.py --check` (which parses every shipped `.php` with the host's `short_open_tag`), and `check_cache_bust.py` against `origin/main` | python, php |
| `php` | the three suites that drive a real PHP server, including the publish endpoint | php |
| `firefox` | the eight browser suites, all of them, then a verdict | firefox, geckodriver, Pillow |

It is deliberately the **same list** as the pre-commit set in
[testing.md](../10-development/testing.md). What gates a merge and what gates a release are one set
of checks, so that "it passed on my machine" and "it is safe to put on the server" stop being two
different claims.

### All eight suites run before the job reports

The `firefox` job runs the browser suites in **one step**, collects the failures and reports at the
end, rather than giving each suite a step of its own.

A step per suite stops at the first failure, and that hid more than it looked like it would:
`test_motion.py` failed on its third check, so `test_editor.py`, `check_hover.py`,
`check_dark_mode.py`, `check_responsive.py` and `check_focus.py` — five suites, most of the
coverage — had **never executed in CI at all**. Fixing them would have meant one three-minute round
trip per suite to discover the next problem.

### The silent-pass trap, and the guard against it

Every browser suite calls `shutil.which("firefox")` and, finding nothing, prints a notice and
**exits 0**. That is right on a laptop without geckodriver installed. It is wrong in CI, where a
failed install would turn eight suites into eight green ticks that proved nothing.

So the workflow requires `php`, `firefox` and `geckodriver` to be on `PATH` in a step of its own,
before any suite runs. Note the exact name: `firefox-esr` from apt installs a binary called
`firefox-esr`, which is not what the suites look for — which is why Firefox is installed from
Mozilla's tarball and symlinked, rather than from apt.

## The deploy workflow

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main`, and on demand. Merging `dev` into `main` is
the approval step; there is no staging site.

```
test       .github/workflows/test.yml, called as a reusable workflow
build      python3 tools/build_deploy_set.py --out _deploy
ssh        write the deploy key, pin the host key, prove the connection
dry run    rsync --delete --itemize-changes --dry-run  →  /tmp/plan.txt
gate       read /tmp/plan.txt; fail the job if it deletes anything protected
sync       rsync --delete             _deploy/site/  →  ~/public_html/
seed       rsync --ignore-existing    _deploy/seed/  →  ~/public_html/content/
verify     python3 tools/verify_live.py https://tech4time.bd
```

Transport is **rsync over SSH**, using a deploy-only key. The host key is pinned in
`known_hosts` from a secret rather than accepted with `ssh-keyscan` on each run — keyscanning into
`known_hosts` accepts whatever answers, which is a formality rather than a check.

### The protect list, and why the gate is not redundant

`rsync --delete` into a cPanel document root is destructive by default, and what it would destroy
is not in the repository: `content/`, `.well-known/`, `cgi-bin/`, `error_log`,
the MultiPHP ini files. The full list and its reasoning is
[ADR 0016](../90-decisions/0016-a-deploy-protects-what-the-panel-owns.md).

The filters prevent those deletions. The gate then reads the dry run and fails the job if any were
proposed anyway. That is deliberately two mechanisms for one rule, because a typo in a filter path
produces a rule that matches nothing, reports no error, and leaves every run green.

**The gate's own pattern was wrong when it was written** — it expected `*deleting ` with one space
where `--itemize-changes` emits three — so it matched nothing and passed everything while looking
entirely healthy. It was caught by running it against a dry run with the filters removed. That is
now how any change to either is verified:

```bash
rsync -a --delete --itemize-changes --dry-run SRC/ DST/ > plan.txt   # no filters
grep -E '^\*deleting[[:space:]]+(content/|\.well-known/|cgi-bin/|error_log)' plan.txt
```

If that prints nothing, the gate is broken. A gate that has never been seen to fail has not been
tested.

### Secrets

Set under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

| Secret | What |
|---|---|
| `SSH_HOST` | the hostname or IP cPanel gives for SSH |
| `SSH_PORT` | cPanel often uses something other than 22 |
| `SSH_USER` | the cPanel account name — `techtime` |
| `SSH_KEY` | the **private** half of a deploy-only key, no passphrase |
| `SSH_HOST_KEY` | one line of `ssh-keyscan -p PORT HOST`, pinned |

Generate the key in cPanel → SSH Access → Manage SSH Keys, and authorize it there. Use a key made
for this and nothing else: it is stored by GitHub, used unattended, and should be revocable without
disturbing anything a person signs in with.

Every secret reaches the shell through `env:` rather than `${{ }}` interpolation. The values here
are trusted; the habit is not about these values.

## Cost

GitHub Actions is free for public repositories and metered for private ones. The `checks` and `php`
jobs take about a minute between them. The `firefox` job is the expensive one — `check_focus.py`
alone makes 1846 assertions across 22 page loads. If minutes become tight, move the `firefox` job to
pull requests and pushes to `main` only, and leave `dev` covered by the other two.
