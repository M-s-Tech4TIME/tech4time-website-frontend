# Motion

**Applies to:** frontend

Everything that moves, and the single rule that governs all of it.

---

## The rule

> **Motion may decorate. It may never be the only way to reach something.**

Every animated feature has a defined state for: JavaScript off, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and the
script failing to load. That state is never "the content is missing".

| Where | What moves | With JavaScript off |
|---|---|---|
| Every section | fades up as it scrolls in | visible, in place |
| Home hero | a terminal session typed a character at a time | the whole session fades in line by line, in CSS |
| About, Company Profile | specialities and photographs as slideshows | every slide at once, in the section's grid |
| Company Profile | experience figures count up | the real figures, which are in the markup |
| Company Profile | client logos arrive a row at a time | all of them, in place |
| Company Profile | a technology sphere you can take hold of and turn | a grid of logos with alt text |
| Pages with a title band | circuitry animating along all four edges | the same circuit, still |

## The scroll reveal

The most important piece, because it is the one that can hide content.

**Markers are applied by rule, not by hand.** `tools/apply_reveals.py` walks every page and marks
targets from one structural rule — each section's header, then its content — so the behaviour is
consistent and nobody has to remember to tag a new section.

```bash
python3 tools/apply_reveals.py            # dry run: report what it would do
python3 tools/apply_reveals.py --write    # apply
python3 tools/apply_reveals.py --strip    # remove every marker
```

**The five dynamic pages are the exception, and the tool says so.** `index.php`, `pages/about/`,
`pages/careers/`, `pages/contact/` and `pages/company-profile/` build part of themselves with a
`foreach`, so the markers on a repeated row live in the template rather than in the emitted
markup. All three modes report those pages and leave them alone. Their markers are maintained by
hand, in the renderer, and the rule they follow is the same one — the section header, then its
content.

**The home page is the one at the repository root**, and that mattered: the tool hardcoded
`ROOT/"index.html"` there and stopped seeing the file the moment it became `index.php` — silently,
because a page with no markers passes every check in `test_motion.py` without any of them testing
anything. It looks for both names now. Five other tools had the same root-level blind spot and were
fixed with it; the list is in the header comment of `index.php`.

On the about page the per-paragraph markers inside a story section are put back at render time by
`about_reveal_paragraphs()`, because the prose is one rich-text field and the number of paragraphs
is a property of the content. See [libraries.md](../server-side/libraries.md#aboutphp).

### The failure that had to be designed out

`animations.js` hides elements so it can reveal them on scroll. If that file never arrives — a
network failure, a blocked request, a syntax error you introduced — **the content stays hidden
forever**.

Three defences, in order:

1. **Nothing is hidden unless the code has already established it can reveal it again.** The hiding
   is applied by script, not by a stylesheet that loads regardless.
2. **`theme-init.js` is synchronous and therefore always runs.** It registers a watchdog that lifts
   the hidden state at the load event, whatever happened to `animations.js`.
3. **Nothing is hidden at all** under `prefers-reduced-motion`, or with scripting off.

`tools/test_motion.py` is the proof: every page, scrolled end to end, with every marked element
required to finish opaque. It is the check to run after touching anything in this area.

## Slideshows

`assets/js/slider.js`. Auto-advancing, and therefore subject to WCAG 2.2.2 — moving content that
starts automatically and lasts more than five seconds must be pausable.

They stop:

- on hover
- on focus
- when the tab is in the background
- **on demand** — there is a pause control, which is the WCAG requirement
- and they never start at all under `prefers-reduced-motion`

Without JavaScript, every slide renders at once in the grid the section already had. The slideshow
is a way of *saving space*, not a way of *storing content*.

---

## The technology sphere

`assets/js/tech-sphere.js`. Company Profile. Draggable in any direction, with momentum.

Without JavaScript it is a plain grid of logos with alt text. It must never be the only place a
technology name appears.

---

## The terminal

`assets/js/terminal.js`. The homepage hero types a session a character at a time, with output
arriving in blocks.

Without JavaScript the whole session fades in line by line in pure CSS — the text is in the markup,
so it is readable and indexable either way.

---

## Writing new motion

Ask three questions before you start:

1. **What does this look like with JavaScript off?** If the answer is "nothing", stop.
2. **What does it do under `prefers-reduced-motion`?** It should not run.
3. **If the script fails, is anything unreachable?** If yes, it must not hide anything.

Then:

- Put keyframes in `assets/css/animations.css`.
- Put behaviour in a module registered on `window.Tech4Time`.
- Check `matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)")` before starting anything.
- If it auto-advances, give it a pause control.
- Run `python3 tools/test_motion.py`.

## Checks

```bash
python3 tools/test_motion.py     # nothing is left hidden, on any page
python3 tools/check_hover.py     # every control visibly responds to a pointer
python3 tools/check_dark_mode.py # both themes, as painted
```
