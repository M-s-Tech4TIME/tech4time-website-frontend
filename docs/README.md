# Tech4TIME — Documentation (frontend)

Everything about this project that is not the code itself: how to set it up, how it is built, where
to change things, how to deploy it, and what to do when something breaks.

**This is the public site.** The editor and everything it needs are in **`tech4time-website-backend`**,
which has its own copy of this documentation covering that half. Entries below that read
*(in tech4time-website-backend)* are there rather than here — the document exists, in the other repository.

**New here?** Read [00-orientation/README.md](00-orientation/README.md), then
[10-development/setup.md](10-development/setup.md). About an hour, and you will be able to work.

## The shape of this directory

```
docs/
├── 00-orientation/   what the project is          read once, first
├── 10-development/   working on it                read while working
├── 20-deployment/    getting it onto a server     read before deploying
├── 30-operations/    keeping it running           read when something breaks
├── 40-reference/     look-up material             read when you need a fact
└── 90-decisions/     why it is the way it is      read when you disagree with it
```

Numbered so the reading order is obvious and so the folders sort usefully. `00` and `10` are for
people building; `20` and `30` are for people running; `40` and `90` are consulted, not read.

## Keeping this true

Documentation that is not maintained is worse than none, because it is believed. Two mechanisms
keep this honest.

**The rule.** Change the code, update the doc that owns it, *in the same commit*. The table below
says which doc that is.

**The check.** `python3 tools/check_docs.py` fails the build when a documented file no longer
exists, a tool or library is undocumented, an internal link is broken, or a doc quotes a value that
no longer matches the code. It cannot read prose — it catches the mechanical half, which is the
half that rots silently.

### Which doc owns what

| Change this | Update this |
|---|---|
| Add or remove a file in `tools/` | [40-reference/tools.md](40-reference/tools.md) |
| Add or remove a `lib/*.php` | [10-development/server-side/libraries.md](10-development/server-side/libraries.md) |
| Change `lib/contract.php` or `lib/publish.php` | [10-development/server-side/publish-api.md](10-development/server-side/publish-api.md) — **and the same file in the backend** |
| Change `api/publish.php` | [10-development/server-side/publish-api.md](10-development/server-side/publish-api.md) |
| Add or remove a page under `pages/` | [00-orientation/repository-map.md](00-orientation/repository-map.md) |
| Change a field in `content/*.json` | [40-reference/content-schemas.md](40-reference/content-schemas.md) |
| Change a constant in `lib/throttle.php` | [40-reference/security-model.md](40-reference/security-model.md) |
| Change `.htaccess` | [40-reference/security-model.md](40-reference/security-model.md) |
| Change the deploy procedure | [20-deployment/](20-deployment/) |
| Change a CSS or JS convention | [10-development/frontend/](10-development/frontend/) |
| Make a decision that constrains future work | a new file in [90-decisions/](90-decisions/) |
| Discover a new failure mode | [30-operations/troubleshooting.md](30-operations/troubleshooting.md) |

## A note on the two repositories

The project is split. **`tech4time-website-frontend`** is this one, serving `tech4time.bd`;
**`tech4time-website-backend`** serves `admin.tech4time.bd` and owns the content.

Every document opens with an **Applies to:** line — `frontend`, `backend`, or `both` — which is what
made the split a move rather than a rewrite. A document marked `both` exists in both repositories
and describes each half from its own side.

**A path in backticks always means *this* repository.** A file in the other half is written with the
repository name in front: `tech4time-website-backend/lib/auth.php`. `tools/check_docs.py` enforces it, so
the two can never be confused in prose.

The decision records are numbered for the project, not for this repository, so
[90-decisions/](90-decisions/) has gaps where a record belongs to the other half. Each gap names
where it went.

See [90-decisions/0011-two-repositories.md](90-decisions/0011-two-repositories.md),
[0017](90-decisions/0017-two-private-stores.md) and
[0018](90-decisions/0018-the-backend-serves-from-a-subdirectory.md).
