# Glossary

**Applies to:** both

Terms used in this documentation and in the code's comments, in the sense this project uses them.

---

### argon2id
The password-hashing algorithm used here, at 32 MB and three passes. Deliberately slow and memory-
hungry, so guessing costs an attacker real hardware. bcrypt at cost 12 is the fallback where a host
lacks it.

### audit log
`t4t-private-admin/audit.log`, **in tech4time-backend**. One JSON line per event — sign-ins
successful and not, password changes,
recovery codes spent. Records; nothing watches it.

### bootstrap window
The gap between deploying the admin and creating the first account, during which the setup page is
reachable and whoever uses it owns the site. Closed by the **setup token**.

### CSP — Content-Security-Policy
The header that tells the browser which origins may load. Here it is `'self'` for everything, which
forbids inline styles and scripts entirely.

### document root
The directory Apache serves a domain from — `/home/USER/public_html`. Nothing above it has a URL,
which is why the **private store** lives beside it rather than inside it.

### drift
Two things that must agree quietly ceasing to. The header copied into sixteen pages; the docs and
the code; the footer and `contact.json`. Most checks in `tools/` exist to catch a kind of drift.

### fail closed / fail open
Whether a component refuses or continues when it cannot do its job. **Authority fails closed** — the
admin refuses to run without its store, and `api/publish.php` refuses a payload it cannot verify.
**Convenience fails open** — the contact form still works if
its rate-limit counter is unreadable.

### master key
`t4t-private/secret.key`. 32 random bytes from which every other key is derived by purpose. Losing
it invalidates every password hash and every recovery code.

### pepper
A secret mixed into a password before hashing, stored **in a different file** from the hash. Unlike
a salt it is not per-password and not stored alongside — which is the point: a stolen `admins.json`
cannot be attacked without also stealing `secret.key`.

### private store
`/home/USER/t4t-private/`, `../t4t-private` locally. Password hashes, the master key, authenticator
secrets, sessions, counters and the audit log. Never committed, never deployed, never inside the
document root.

### progressive enhancement
Building so the page works without JavaScript and improves with it. A hard rule here, not an
aspiration.

### recovery code
One of ten single-use codes issued at enrolment, each good for one sign-in in place of the
authenticator. Stored hashed under a key derived from the master key.

### replica
The frontend's copy of content it does not own. After the split, the backend is the source of truth
and pushes a copy; the frontend renders from the copy and never asks at render time.

### reveal
The scroll animation that fades sections in. Marked by rule via `tools/apply_reveals.py`, and
carefully designed never to leave anything hidden.

### salt
Random bytes mixed into a password before hashing, different for every password, **stored inside the
hash string** by `password_hash()`. That is why there is no separate salt field to manage.

### section
One editable page in the admin — a row in `ADMIN_SECTIONS` plus a file in
`tech4time-backend/sections/`. Reached at `https://admin.tech4time.bd/?s=<name>`.

### setup token
A value written to `t4t-private/setup-token.txt` that `tech4time-backend/public/setup.php` demands. Readable only with
server access; destroyed the moment an account exists.

### shared markup
The head, header, footer, dock and script blocks that must be byte-identical on every page. Source
of truth is `tools/templates/`; never edited in a page.

### sprite
`assets/icons/sprite.svg`, the master icon set. Pages **inline** the symbols they use rather than
linking to it, because Chromium and WebKit do not resolve `<use>` across documents.

### token_version
A counter on each account, recorded in every session. Bumping it on a password change ends every
other session at once.

### TOTP — Time-based One-Time Password
RFC 6238. The six digits an authenticator app shows, derived from a shared secret and the current
30-second window. Implemented by hand in `tech4time-backend/lib/totp.php` and checked against the RFC's own test
vectors.

### throttle
The counters in `t4t-private/throttle.json` that make guessing cost something. Applied **before** the
password is verified, so a lockout cannot be used as an oracle.

### watchdog
The fallback in `theme-init.js` that lifts the scroll-reveal's hidden state at the load event, in
case `animations.js` never arrives. The reason a failed script cannot leave content invisible.
