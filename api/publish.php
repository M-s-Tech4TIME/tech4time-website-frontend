<?php
/**
 * Tech4TIME — where the backend's content arrives.
 *
 * FRONTEND ONLY. The public site's one inbound endpoint, and the only thing on
 * this host that writes content/.
 *
 * The admin at admin.tech4time.bd owns the content. On save it writes its own
 * record and posts a signed copy here; this verifies it, re-sanitises it and
 * writes the replica the two dynamic pages render from. Nothing here ever
 * calls the backend — docs/90-decisions/0010-backend-pushes-content.md.
 *
 * THE URL IS /api/publish.php, WITH THE EXTENSION
 * ADR 0010 wrote it as /api/publish. It is the plain path instead, so that the
 * one route content travels over does not depend on a rewrite rule: .htaccess
 * is not read by the local dev server, would have to be reproduced on any
 * server this moves to, and is the single file most likely to arrive damaged
 * or not at all. A path that is just a file works everywhere, unchanged.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS SEPARATE — see lib/publish.php.
 * In short: the signature says who, the timestamp says when, the revision
 * stops a replay from rolling the site backwards, and the contract version
 * stops a document being written in a shape this side would mis-render.
 *
 * IT RE-SANITISES WHAT IT IS SENT.
 * A signature proves origin, not safety. If the admin host were ever
 * compromised, the public site should still not render script — so every rich
 * field goes back through this side's own lib/html.php before it is written.
 *
 * WHAT IT ANSWERS
 *   200  {"ok":true,  "revision":12, "footer_synced":"<sha256>"}
 *   4xx  {"ok":false, "code":"not-newer", "revision":12}
 *
 * The current revision is in every answer the caller is entitled to, so the
 * backend and tools/reconcile.py learn this side's state from any attempt and
 * need no second endpoint to ask. It is withheld until the signature has
 * verified: a stranger gets the refusal and nothing about what is here.
