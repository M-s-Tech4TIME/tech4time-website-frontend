/**
 * Tech4TIME — the wire between the two halves.
 *
 * SHARED FILE. Byte-identical in tech4time-website-frontend and tech4time-website-backend.
 * tools/check_shared_lib.py compares the two against a committed digest.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * The backend owns the content. On save it writes its own record and pushes a
 * signed copy to the public site, which verifies it, re-sanitises it and writes
 * its replica. The public site never calls the backend during a request —
 * docs/90-decisions/0010-backend-pushes-content.md for why.
 *
 * This file is only the format: how a document is wrapped, signed and checked.
 * Sending it is the backend's lib/publish_client.php; receiving it is the
 * frontend's api/publish.php. Both are one-sided, and neither belongs here.
 *
 * THE ENVELOPE
 *   {
 *     "contract_version": 1,        the shape; see lib/contract.php
 *     "document":         "careers",
 *     "revision":         12,       monotonic per document
 *     "published":        "2026-08-26T09:14:03+00:00",
 *     "data":             { … }     the document itself
 *   }
 *
 * over HTTP as
 *   POST /api/publish
 *   Content-Type:     application/json
 *   X-T4T-Timestamp:  1756199643
 *   X-T4T-Signature:  <key fingerprint>:<hex hmac-sha256>
 *
 * and the signed string is "<timestamp>.<body>" — the timestamp inside the
 * signature and not merely beside it, or moving it would cost an attacker
 * nothing.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CHECK IS FOR, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE
 *
 *   the signature   proves the payload came from something holding the key.
 *                   It says nothing about whether the payload is safe, which
 *                   is why the receiver re-sanitises every rich field through
 *                   its own lib/html.php afterwards.
 *
 *   the timestamp   bounds how long a captured request stays useful. Five
 *                   minutes, either way, because the two clocks are different
 *                   machines and a window shorter than their drift is an
 *                   outage rather than a defence.
 *
 *   the revision    is what actually stops a replay from doing damage. Inside
 *                   the window a captured request is still perfectly signed —
 *                   but it carries a revision the receiver already holds, and
 *                   a document must be STRICTLY newer to be written. So the
 *                   replay is a no-op rather than a rollback of the live site
 *                   to whatever was published five minutes ago.
 *
 *   the version     refuses a shape this side does not implement, rather than
 *                   writing a document it would then mis-render. This is the
 *                   real guarantee that the two repositories are in step; the
 *                   committed digest is only hygiene.
 *
 * THE KEY
 * publish.key in the private store, 32 random bytes as 64 hex characters, and
 * THE SAME BYTES on both hosts. It is never derived from secret.key: the two
 * sides have separate stores and separate master keys, so anything derived
 * would differ by construction and every publish would fail.
 *
 * It is never created on demand either, for the same reason a derived one
 * would not do. A key that appears by itself appears differently on each host,
 * and the failure would read as "signature rejected" for as long as it took
 * somebody to think of it. Both sides refuse to start without one and say what
 * to do — tools/make_publish_key.py.
 *
 * Every signature carries the key's fingerprint, per
 * docs/90-decisions/0014-derived-secrets-name-their-key.md, so a receiver
 * holding a different key answers "that is not the key I have" instead of
 * "wrong signature". The two send you to completely different places.
