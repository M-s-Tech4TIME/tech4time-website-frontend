/**
 * Tech4TIME — the private store.
 *
 * Where the secrets live, and the keys derived from them. Nothing here is ever
 * served over HTTP, ever committed to git, or ever written by a deploy.
 *
 * WHY NOT content/
 * content/ is kept out of the web by .htaccess: RewriteRule ^content/ - [F,L]
 * and a FilesMatch on .json. That is the right protection for site copy — if it
 * ever failed, a stranger would read the office addresses the contact page
 * already shows them.
 *
 * A password hash is not site copy. If that same protection failed — a host
 * that ignores .htaccess, mod_rewrite switched off, an .htaccess replaced by a
 * careless upload — the file would be served as plain text and an offline
 * attack on the hash could begin with nobody knowing it had started. A
 * directory rule is a policy the server chooses to apply. A file outside the
 * document root cannot be requested at all, because no URL maps to it.
 *
 * So the private store sits BESIDE the document root, never inside it, and
 * t4t_private_dir() refuses rather than accept a location it cannot vouch for.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS
 *   host   $T4T_PRIVATE, or /home/USER/t4t-private beside /home/USER/public_html
 *   local  $T4T_PRIVATE, set by tools/serve.py and by the test harnesses
 *
 * TWO STORES, ONE PER HALF
 * The backend keeps its own at /home/USER/t4t-private-admin — the accounts,
 * the master key that peppers them, the sessions. They are separate because
 * the two sides are meant to be separable: the frontend must be able to run
 * on a machine with no access to the backend's secrets at all, because that
 * is where this is going. See docs/20-deployment/environments.md.
 *
 * The one thing both stores hold is publish.key, and it is the same bytes on
 * purpose — it is what the two sign to each other with.
 *
 * Not reachable over HTTP: .htaccess forbids /lib/.

 * secrets, no recovery codes and no sessions — they moved to

 * convention: t4t_private_path() throws on a name it does not know, so there
