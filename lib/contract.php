/**
 * Tech4TIME — the contract between the two repositories.
 *
 * SHARED FILE. Byte-identical in tech4time-website-frontend and tech4time-website-backend.
 * Change it in one and you must change it in the other in the same breath;
 * tools/check_shared_lib.py compares the two against a committed digest and
 * fails the build in both when they part.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE
 * The shape of a document, and nothing else. Field lists, the defaults a
 * missing key falls back to, the normalising that turns whatever arrived into
 * that shape, and the queries that read it. Both sides must agree on all of
 * this or they are not describing the same job post.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT BELONG HERE
 *   authoring   validation with human-readable messages, the form model, the
 *               editor's pickers — the backend's business, and the frontend
 *               has no form to validate
 *   rendering   JobPosting and ContactPage structured data, flag pictures,
 *               tel: hrefs — the frontend's business, and the backend does
 *               not render the public page
 *
 * The line is: if the two sides disagreeing about it would corrupt a document,
 * it is here. If disagreeing would only make one side's own page look wrong,
 * it is not.
 *
 * CONTRACT_VERSION
 * Every published payload carries it, and the receiving side refuses a version
 * it does not implement — see lib/publish.php. That runtime check is the real
 * guarantee, because it fires on the real path on the day, and it refuses
 * rather than writing a document it would then mis-render.
 *
 * The digest comparison is hygiene for accidental local edits and no more. It
 * cannot catch a deliberate change: bump the version in both repositories and
 * both digests agree again while the two hold different code. Only the
 * receiver checking what it was actually sent can catch that.
 *
 * BUMP IT when a change would make a document written by one version render
 * wrongly under the other: a field renamed, a field's meaning changed, a list
 * that becomes a scalar. Do NOT bump it for a new optional field that older
 * code simply ignores, or for anything in the two lists above.
 *
 * Not reachable over HTTP: the frontend's .htaccess forbids /lib/, and the
 * backend's lib/ sits outside its document root.

 * disagreeing about the same picture -- a ladder the browser cannot choose
 * from correctly is worse than no ladder, because without sizes= a browser
 * assumes the picture fills the viewport and picks the LARGEST rung.
 *
 * THESE NUMBERS WERE MEASURED, NOT ESTIMATED. Firefox, every page, ten
 * viewports from 320 to 1920, each in an iframe of its own so the width asked
 * for is the width tested -- the same technique and the same reason as
 * tools/check_responsive.py. Two of them are not where anybody would guess:
 *
 *   - about.story is widest at 768 (693px), NOT on a desktop. One column up to
 *     768 and two above it, so the last single-column width is the largest the
 *     picture is ever drawn; at 1280 it is 534.
 *   - company.clients is widest at 360 (249px), also not on a desktop. The
 *     grid drops to one column, so a phone draws the biggest logo tile.
 *   - about.accreditations is widest at 376 (282px), for about.story's reason
 *     one breakpoint lower: it is the last width at which one badge fills the
 *     row. From 380 up the tile is capped at 14rem and the badge never passes
 *     174, which is why the sizes= has two arms rather than one number.
 *
 *     THAT CAP IS WHY THIS SLOT HAS A WIDTH AT ALL. The tile is capped, not
 *     the track: auto-fit collapses the tracks nothing sits in and divides the
 *     row between what is left, so without a ceiling the badge came back 318px
 *     on a desktop holding three and about 1200px holding one. A width that
 *     depends on how many rows the editor has added cannot be written here.
 *     Capping the TRACK instead was measured too and is worse -- auto-fit
 *     counts the tracks that fit from the track's MAXIMUM, so a 14rem ceiling
 *     also delays every column: one badge per row until 480, four across a
 *     1440 desktop where seven fit.
 *
 * Guessing either would have shipped a picture too small on the width that
 * needed it most, and nothing in this repository would have said so.
 *
 * 'width' is the CSS width at the widest point. The uploader stores it at 1x,
 * 2x and 3x for the screens that have those densities, never upscaling past
 * what arrived and never past its own ceiling.
 *
 * A slot with width 0 DOES NOT LADDER, and each has a reason:
 *   - branding.file is a deliverable somebody downloads, not something a page
 *     draws. One file, at the download ceiling.
 *   - seo.share is read by scrapers that do not implement srcset and want
 *     exactly 1200x630. A ladder there is ignored at best.
 *   - seo.logo is Organization.logo in the structured data: one image, named
 *     once, by a consumer that picks nothing.
 *
 * To re-measure after a layout change, see "If you are measuring geometry"
 * in tech4time-website-frontend/docs/10-development/testing.md -- named with
 * the repository because this file is shared and the pages are over there.

           the footer       101px           fixed
           the About row    274 -> 693px    widest at 768, like about.story

       The ladder is cut from the HEADER's width, because that is the drawing
       that is on all seventeen pages; the About row takes the widest rung it
       finds rather than a rung of its own. 180 reproduces the 180/360/540 set
       the site ships with, so an upload replaces those files like for like.

       sizes= is the header's alone. The footer draws one file and says so by
       having none, and the About row likewise -- see settings_logo_largest()
       in tech4time-website-frontend/lib/settings.php, named with the
       repository because this file is shared and the renderer is over there.

       IT SAID '(max-width: 48em) 140px, 180px' AND THAT WAS NEVER TRUE. The
       lockup's height is a clamp() and its width follows the 360x128 ratio, so
       it is 79px at 320, 100px at 768 and 112.5px above about 1035 -- never
       140, never 180. Declaring 180 does not make a picture bigger; it makes
       the browser pick a file for a slot 60% wider than the one it is drawing
       into, so a 3x phone took the 540px file (44 kB) where the 360 (27 kB)
       is more than it can show. Both steps round UP from the measurement,
       which is the safe direction: slightly more pixels than the screen can
       draw, never fewer. */

   the contact page would be a statement nobody made. But two copies of a fact

   has a comma on one page and not on the other. Nothing told anyone.

   So the copies stay and the DIVERGENCE is reported. What follows answers one
   question -- does the policy still state the current value? -- and answers it
   by containment rather than by field, because these facts live inside prose
   and an address block, not in slots of their own.

   IT IS A NOTICE, NOT A REFUSAL. The editor draws it; nothing here blocks a

   that after an office move, whichever page you edited first could not be
   saved -- and there is no order that avoids that. */

   WHAT IS HERE, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT.

   A PAGE's own metadata is not here. Its title, description, share title,
   breadcrumb, crawl directive and sitemap tuning live in that page's own
   document, in the meta band every document has -- see the page metadata block
   near the top of this file. One screen edits all of them, and the values stay
   with the page they describe. Moving them into this document was considered
   and rejected: content/ is never synced by a deploy, so a document assembled
   from the repository's committed seeds would carry SEED titles onto a host
   whose live copies hold titles edited since, and the reversion would be
   silent. Leaving them where they are removes that failure mode rather than
   managing it.

   What IS here is everything that belongs to the SITE rather than to any one
   page: the Organization graph, the default share card, the colours, the
   crawl file and the web manifest -- plus the 404 page's record, because that
   page renders no content document and never will.

   ROUTES ARE CODE. SEO_ROUTES below cannot be added to, renamed, removed or
   reordered from the editor. Adding a page is a code change, as it always was,
   and its card then appears by itself -- which is what makes it impossible to
   orphan a record or point one at a URL that does not resolve.

   11. Chrome — the shape of the header, footer and dock
   ========================================================================== */

/*
   THE CHROME'S ICONS ARE INLINED AT RENDER TIME, NOT SCANNED FOR.

   tools/inject_icons.py finds the symbols a page needs by scanning its source
   for a literal href="#name". Once lib/body.php emits the header, footer and
   dock there is no such literal in any page's source, and the block that tool
   writes would come back empty on eleven of the seventeen pages -- every icon
   they carry comes from those three blocks.

   The answer is the one lib/services.php and lib/certifications.php already
   use for content icons: the renderer works out its own set and writes a
   SECOND sprite, marked content-sprite rather than icon-sprite so the tool's
   non-greedy match is left alone. Two <symbol> elements sharing an id overlap
   harmlessly -- tools/audit_pages.py exempts symbol ids from its duplicate-id
   check for exactly this reason -- and it audits RENDERED output, so "every
   <use> resolves to an inlined <symbol>" is already proved on the only text a
   visitor receives.

   THE ALTERNATIVE WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED, in lib/services.php, on a model
   offering seventy-six icons: naming them all up front cost +7 to +10 KB
   gzipped per page. The chrome is smaller, but the argument is the same and
   the conclusion is stronger here, because this list is inlined on ALL
   seventeen pages rather than seven. A page carries the icons it draws.

   So what follows is the model's business only -- which icons may be CHOSEN,
   and which mark stands for what. Nothing here decides what gets inlined.

 *
 * Deliberately short. The bar is four buttons wide at the bottom of a phone
 * screen, and the list only has to cover the kinds of place a slot can point
 * at -- the site's own pages and its services. One mark per kind, not one per
 * taste.
 *
 * Every name here must also be in ADMIN_ICONS in the backend's lib/admin.php,
 * or the editor's live preview draws an empty box for it;

/* -------------------------------------------------------- the document

   THE CHROME IS THE FURNITURE AROUND EVERY PAGE: the header, the footer and
   the small-screen dock. It was literal markup in seventeen page files, kept
   in step by tools/propagate_shared.py, and that arrangement had produced
   three live defects by the time it was replaced -- a service list that said
   "Human Resource Provision" where the services document said something else,
   a seventh service that could never appear in the footer at all, and phone
   numbers that went stale for weeks because a script had to be run by hand
   before a deploy.

   A LINK POINTS AT A ROUTE, NEVER AT A URL. Every destination here is a key:
   'about', 'services', 'service:cybersecurity'. SEO_ROUTES already says routes
   are code and cannot be added, renamed or removed from the editor, and this
   follows from that -- the nav is the one component on every page of the site,
   and a nav that can point anywhere can point at a 404. Picking also means a
   service renamed in the editor renames its footer link by itself, which is
   the first of the three defects above, fixed by construction.

   THE FOOTER'S CONTACT ROWS ARE ITS OWN AND ARE NOT SYNCED. That is a
   deliberate choice and the opposite of the services column beside them. The
   contact page holds everything, in full; the footer holds the part worth
   putting in a footer, in whatever order and wording suits it, with rows that
   can be hidden without hiding anything on the contact page. What keeps the
   two honest is a NOTICE rather than a rule -- the editor draws it and nothing
   here refuses a save. The privacy policy struck the same bargain for the same
   reason -- see "THE POLICY STATES FACTS ANOTHER DOCUMENT ALREADY MANAGES" in
   section 9 -- and it is the pattern tools/check_shared_facts.py reports on.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT STORED HERE:

     the services column   derived from content/services.json, so a seventh
                           service appears by itself and a hidden one goes
     the social links      derived from the SEO document's sameas rows, so a
                           URL is changed in one place and the footer can never
                           disagree with the structured data
     the four columns      the grid is code. Their HEADINGS and CONTENTS are
                           here; their number and order are not, because a
                           footer that can be given a fifth column is a footer
                           that can be broken at a width nobody tested
     the dock's circuit    decoration with nothing to say, and no content

/**
 * Every footer contact value the contact page does not carry.
 *
 * Returns [['kind' => 'phone'|'email'|'address', 'label' => …, 'value' => …], …]
 * in the footer's own row order. Empty means the two agree.
 *
 * ONE DIRECTION, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. What this exists to catch is a
 * footer value that has gone STALE -- the Brussels telephone numbers were wrong
 * for weeks under the old arrangement, and nothing said so. The other
 * direction, "the contact page has something the footer does not", is not
 * drift: it is what a footer IS. The contact page holds three offices in full
 * and the footer holds the part worth putting in a footer, so reporting the
 * remainder would fire on every correctly-short footer there has ever been,
 * and an alarm nobody can silence is an alarm everybody learns to ignore.
 *
 * An operator who wants the rest can press Copy from the Contact page.
 *
 * COMPARED BY VALUE, NEVER BY LABEL OR BY ROW. A footer row called "Head
 * office" and a contact office called "Bangladesh" are the same office if they
 * carry the same address, and renaming either is not drift. Telephone numbers
 * are compared as bare digits -- "+880 1320571562" and "+880 1320 571562" are
 * one number -- and everything else through privacy_fact_key(), which folds
 * case, collapses whitespace and drops commas and full stops. That is what
 * makes this useful rather than noisy: it reports a different street and stays
 * quiet about a different comma.
 *
 * A HIDDEN FOOTER ROW IS NOT COMPARED. Hiding one is how an operator says "not
 * in the footer", and it cannot be stale if nobody can read it.
 *
 * HOURS ARE NOT COMPARED EITHER, deliberately. The footer writes "Sun - Thu:
 * 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM" as one line of prose, the contact page writes the same
 * words in its own field, and the SEO screen holds the machine-readable
 * version in days and 24-hour times. Three spellings of one fact would report
 * each other forever; tools/check_shared_facts.py is where that pair is looked
 * at, and it looks at the two that are meant to be the same words.

/*
   WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT PART OF ANY OTHER.

   The editor owns almost every word on the site. It owned none of the
   IDENTITY: the logo, the favicon, the colours and where the contact form's
   mail goes were files in a repository, changeable only by a developer running
   a script and shipping a deploy.

   None of it belongs to a page. The logo is in the header, the footer, the
   About page, the admin's own rail, Organization.logo, JobPosting's hiring
   organisation, the favicon set, the branding kit and the share card -- nine
   places across five documents and two repositories. Putting it in any one of
   them would make the other eight read from a document about something else.
   So it is its own document, and everything that draws a mark reads it.

   IT IS NOT A PAGE, so it has no meta band. Chrome is the same and for the
   same reason: a document with no <head> of its own has nothing to put in one.

   THE DEFAULTS ARE WHAT SHIPS, NOT WHAT SOMEBODY TYPED. Every value below was
   read off the files it replaces -- the logo record out of content/chrome.json,
   the colours out of assets/css/theme.css, the address out of the contact
   handler's own constant. A fresh install therefore renders byte for byte what
   the site renders today, and tools/test_settings.py asserts exactly that.

 * boundary, which is the ink on a filled button. A token it has no pair for is
 * a token nothing could say is safe -- so exposing one would mean offering a
 * picker whose only honest answer is "I do not know".
 *
 * Three tokens in theme.css are deliberately NOT here, and the same rule
 * explains all three. --artwork-plate and --artwork-plate-dark are the ground
 * another company's logo is drawn on, and their docblocks record that NOT
 * flipping them with the theme is the bug they exist to prevent.

 * knows, and none is a brand decision.
