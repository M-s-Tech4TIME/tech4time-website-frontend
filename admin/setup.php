/**
 * Tech4TIME — creating the first account.
 *
 * Runs once, on a fresh install, and refuses ever after.
 *
 * THE WINDOW THIS PAGE OPENS, AND WHAT CLOSES IT
 * Between deploying the admin and creating an account, a page that creates the
 * administrator is reachable — and whoever creates it owns the website. Being
 * first is not a defence; the gap between an upload finishing and somebody
 * getting round to setting up can be days.
 *
 * So this asks for a value that exists only in the private directory on the
 * server's own disk, which no URL maps to. Reading it takes SSH, cPanel's
 * Terminal or its File Manager — the access that whoever is setting this up
 * has, and a stranger does not. The token is created on demand and destroyed
 * the moment an account exists, so the window is shut by the code rather than
 * by a step somebody has to remember.
 *
 * Skipped when the request comes from the machine itself, by peer address and
 * not by any header, so local development and the test suite are not made to
 * fetch a file they could simply have read.
 *
 * ORDER OF EVENTS
 * The account is not written until the authenticator app has been proven to
 * work. An admin enrolled but unable to produce a code is an admin locked out
 * on the first sign-in, and this is the one moment when that is still free to
 * put right.

   that demands it has rendered — not first appear once they have already
   guessed wrong. Called for that side effect; the value is never shown here,
   because a page that displays the token proves nothing about who is reading
   it.

   auth_has_accounts() is in that condition because of what it costs to leave
   out. The redirect above lets one case through on purpose — stage 'codes',
   so the recovery codes can be shown after the account exists — and this line
   ran on that render too. auth_setup_done() had just deleted the token; this
   put it straight back, seconds later, and it then sat in the private store
   indefinitely. Found on the live host: setup-complete logged at 14:13:40 and
   setup-token.txt still there, mtime 14:13.

   The token was inert — with an account present and no 'codes' stage in the
   session, a stranger is redirected to login.php before it is ever compared —
   but the file's own header promises it is "destroyed the moment an account
   exists", and it was not. */
